pywst : WST and RWST for astrophysics
=====================================

This package is designed to easily perform WST and RWST analysis for astrophysical data.

Features:
* Computation of the WST of real and complex images, locally or globally.
* Computation of the RWST of real and complex images based on a RWST model, locally or globally.
* Possibility to work with a batch of images.
* Two standard RWST models are proposed and one can easily implement his own model.
* Convenient handling of WST and RWST coefficients.
* Control on the normalization of WST coefficients and on the computation of means of local coefficients.
* Easy visualization of WST and RWST coefficients.
* Comparisons of WST and RWST coefficients.
